# livehouse-location-analysis

**This project is in progress!**

## Background

With the launch of certain veiled policy in Beijing, diversion of consumers’ entertainment, and the departure of metalheads in Beijing,  lots of live house have gone out of business in the past two years, leaving the ecstasy in the live a forsaken and distant memory.

>“An opportunity to know deeper about this city was offered and I could hide myself in the corner of a live house at night. Everyone was equal here no matter how crazy and weird you were, and you could be yourself without judgement.”

E.g.愚公移山(Yugongyishan Livehouse) now is a retail store.

## quick wiki: what’s a live house?

A **[live house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_house)** is a Japanese **live music club** – a [music venue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_venue) featuring live music. The term is a Japanese coinage and is mainly used in East Asia.

It most frequently refers to smaller venues, which may double as bars, especially featuring rock, jazz, blues, and folk music. 

And this project will emphasize the [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music) live house.

## INTRODUCTION

### project feature

A **location analysis** with **quantitative** and **qualitative** methodologies

*with what I learn in urban planning and data science* 

*in memory of the previous live house experience*

*for the hope of a better place for subcultural groups like metalheads*

### aim

(Supposing that  I have sufficient money)

to invest, locate, and design a live house

where metalheads can appreciate live🎸 and drink beer🍻 and I can have maximized profit💰

### estimated outcomes

1. an analysis **report** *`.pdf and .gpkg`* **MAIN**
2. a **guiding template** for location analysis with open source data and code in this project *`GitHub repository`*
3. a **video** recording my journey in this project  *`.mp4`*
4. live house **surface design** with [rhino python](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/) with emphasis on develop instead of design *`.py and .3dm`*

### PROJECT VALUE

- Combine **qualitative** and **quantitive** methodologies to form comprehensive result, which few previous study did.
- Use program to increase efficiency, mainly python.
- Will be completely open source and handy to use (except for the ethnographic content that interviewees may not want to public)
